# Project: Digital Business Card by Jorge Gomez
# Code Reviewer: Shant Dashjian


## What You Did Well:

1. You met the requirements of this project:
    1. Fill in your own information.
    2. Separate components for:
        1. Info *
        2. About
        3. Interests
        4. Footer
2. Creative: You used Samuel L. Jackson as the developer, and had all icons link to his IMDB page. 
3. The quality of your code is very code, readable, organized, and well-formatted.
4. You mostly followed naming conventions.


## Suggestions for Improvement:

1. Follow the React naming convention, naming the file the same name as the component.
2. Rather than re-inventing the wheel, check out the React Icons library: https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/
3. Change the mouse cursor to pointer when hovering over button to indicate clickability.


## Conclusion:

You met and exceeded the objectives of this project. I hope you found my suggestions useful. Keep on coding.
